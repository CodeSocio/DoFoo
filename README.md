# DoFoo

DoFoo i.e. Donate Food is a mobile application where the users can find listings of food requirements from various charities, contact them and donate the excess food they possess.

## Purpose

DoFoo (Donate Food) is an initiative to resolve the **food scarcity** and **wastage issues**
in and around our homes. It is a **non-profitable application** that acts as a bridge between
a food donor and charities.

We aim to connect the people having excess food with the needy and eradicate the food
scarcity issues in the society. We want to make sure that not a single individual sleeps
with an empty stomach.

>We intend to resolve issues in the society with our engineering discipline and technical
skills. Any prankster or scammer acting as donor/recipient will be themselves responsible
for any frauds in the process.

You can always use this platform to find the needy and fill their tummy with the excess
amount of food you have. However, no one has ever become poor from giving.
DoFoo is a robust application with real-time use. The application has a scope to eradicate
food scarcity and wastage issues in the city and thus, we are looking forward to release
the application on Google PlayStore.

The application will be deployed and fully functional with technical support for public use
in the city in the upcoming days. We are going to start a campaign along with pamphlets
and educative videos to educate the local charities and audience about the effective use
of the application. People with excess food left over at their functions, parties, events,
etc. will soon have the easiest solution to dispatch that extra food i.e. DoFoo.
